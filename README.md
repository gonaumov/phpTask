PHP task
=============

This is php task that I created for fun only.
Some things are more fun in php. There are numerous pre-build functions for working with arrays, and they are fun.


Task requirements: 
-------------- 

0. Create an array from N simple random numbers, not bigger than M. 
0. Remove dublicates numbers. 
0. Display most popular number among dublicates.
